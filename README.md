OlympicMedalAnalysis_Visualization
=====================

## Overview:
This project is designed to evaluate participants' ability to interpret historical Olympic medal data through interactive visualizations, including line and area charts. The study focuses on how individuals perceive and analyze Olympic medal trends across various countries from 1896-2020.

## Key Features:
- Interactive Web Questionnaire: Developed using the Python Flask framework to create a web-based questionnaire where participants analyze Olympic medal data from visual charts.
- Data Visualizations: Line and area charts created using Matplotlib to display medal distributions for top countries over the years.
- Experiment Design: Includes a series of timed questions based on these charts, testing participants' comprehension and analytical skills.
- Analysis: The response times and accuracy of answers are analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the visualizations.

## Team Members
This project was developed collaboratively by Ayesha Rahman, Sandra Guran, Natalie Leung and Geeyoon Lim. Together, we implemented various components of the 3D rendering application as part of our coursework. In the attached report, a table outlining the distribution of individual and collaborative tasks is presented.

## Tasks Breakdown

1. Project Setup: Develop a web-based questionnaire using the Python Flask framework. Host the questionnaire on PythonAnywhere.

2. Data Visualization, create two main charts:

Line Chart: Displaying medal counts for the top 10 countries from 1896-2020.
Area Chart: Illustrating total medal counts for selected countries from 1896-2020.
Generate subgraphs for each question to help guide participants.

3. Questionnaire;Design 20 timed questions: 10 based on the line chart. 10 based on the area chart. The questions are randomized and designed to test participants' ability to interpret trends in the data.

4. Participant Recruitment: Gather 10 participants for the study. Ensure informed consent and anonymity throughout the experiment.

5.Data Collection: Record response times and track the accuracy of answers for each participant.
Analyze how well participants can comprehend the visual data.

6. Statistical Analysis: Analyze participant response times using descriptive statistics. Track correct and incorrect responses to evaluate comprehension. Perform t-tests to compare response times for line and area charts.

7. Results Reporting: Summarize findings on participantsâ€™ understanding of the historical distribution of Olympic medals. Report key insights, including response times, accuracy rates, and the absence of correlation between time spent and answer accuracy.

## Technologies Used:
Python Flask: Web framework for the questionnaire backend.
Pandas & Matplotlib: Libraries used for data processing and visualization.
